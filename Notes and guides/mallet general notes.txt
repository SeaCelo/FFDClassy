Installation

As of this note, using version 2.0.8 from here: http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php

Might want to add Mallet to the $PATH. In Terminal:
	echo $PATH    #this will print the current path, to check. 
	nano .bash_profile		#to edit
	##include this line somewhere:
	# MALLET
	export PATH=$PATH:/Users/mlafleur/mallet-2.0.8/bin

write out and exit
If you don't have this, just navigate to the /mallet-2.0.8/bin and run the command from there.

See file "mallet steps.txt" for running it



*note: using ngrams runs out of memory. Give 8gb to mallet seems to work, and lets os x manage any paging and vm 
editing the binary:
rocket:cd /Users/mlafleur/Desktop/themes/mallet-2.0.8/bin 
(Note: the binary is not in /Applications/
rocket:bin mlafleur$ nano mallet
	edit the line to read MEMORY=8g
