Step by step to replicate results

1) prepare training and target data. sdg-pre-hlpf and alldesa

2) run training and infer scripts (see "final-steps" for notes):
cd ~/Desktop/themes/sdg_final
./train_sdg_classifier.sh     (only needed if updating model)
./infer_sdg_wess.sh
./infer_sdg_rwss.sh
./infer_sdg_alldesa.sh
